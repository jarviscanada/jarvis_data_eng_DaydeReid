# Dayde Reid - Jarvis Consulting

I am a recent graduate of the University of Toronto Scarborough, where I earned my Honours Bachelor of Science. I studied computer science as a specialist program, focusing on software engineering, as I prefer the more practical side of computer science. During my schooling, I managed to get a bit of experience in the workplace, as I had two co-op job positions. The first was an 8-month term at Parks Canada, where I helped developed and release a guide app for one of their parks for both iOS and Android. The second was at Loblaw Digital, where I spent 4 months improving and maintaining one of there existing ecommerce websites. I joined the Jarvis Consulting Group a few months after graduating and began training for a Data Engineering position. Right now, I am looking for a position at a company where I can put the skills I have learned to good use, while hopefully also continuing to learn so that I might better myself further.
